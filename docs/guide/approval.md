# Asking a person

Four of the thirteen tools change who can reach this instance, or take
notifications away from people who may not have read them yet. All four **ask a
person first**.

Not a `confirm: true` argument the model can set. Not a token the model reads out
of its own previous result. A dialog, raised through [MCP
elicitation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/client/elicitation),
that goes to the client and is shown to whoever is sitting there.

The specification says a client _should_ keep a human in the loop:

> there **SHOULD** always be a human in the loop with the ability to deny tool
> invocations

This server does not rely on that. It raises the question itself, and until an
answer comes back, nothing happens.

## What asks, and when

| Tool | When it asks |
| --- | --- |
| `delete_messages` | always |
| `delete_user` | always |
| `manage_user_access` | always |
| `create_user` | always |
| everything else | never |

`create_user` is the odd one on that list, because it destroys nothing. It is the
mirror image of `delete_user`: bringing an account into existence is a change to
who may reach this instance, and no annotation carries that — `destructiveHint` is
about what a call takes away. Its own annotation has said “which is why it is
guarded” since the tool was written, and it was not.

Publishing is deliberately **not** on the list. Sending a notification destroys
nothing, and it reaches people who cannot un-receive it — an outbound effect, not
a destructive one. The control for that is `NTFY_TOPICS`, which bounds where this
server may publish at all, and an ntfy account scoped to those topics behind it. A
dialog before every notification would be how people learn to tick without
reading.

## What the dialog contains

Topics, counts and usernames. Never the content of a notification, which was
written by whoever could publish to the topic — on an open instance, anyone who
knows its name.

And never the **password** `create_user` was given. It is a live credential, and
the prompt is read back by a person and by a model alike, so it is in neither the
text nor the token's binding. A consequence worth knowing: on the fallback path a
token issued for one password works with another, because what the approval is
about is the account name.

```
This will create the account "publisher".

It becomes an account on this instance. Nothing is reachable through it until
manage_user_access grants a topic — but whoever has the password can then
authenticate as it.
```

The approval is bound to its target, so one obtained for a call cannot be
replayed against another. For a *set* of targets the binding is a fingerprint of
the exact list: an approval for `["a"]` does not execute `["a", "b"]`.

## Clients that cannot show a dialog

Not every MCP client implements elicitation, and a stateless gateway may not be
able to speak for the one it is currently serving. Rather than refuse to work —
which pushes people towards switching the guard off entirely — the tool falls
back to a **two-call token**: the first call returns a random string, the second
has to quote it back.

Be clear about what that proves, because this server is:

> the token proves the call was made twice with the same arguments, and nothing
> more.

A model can read the token out of the first result and call again in the same
turn without anybody seeing it. It catches a widened target set; it does not
catch a model that was talked into the whole thing. The fallback text says so
rather than implying somebody approved.

## Switching the dialog off

```sh
ELICITATION=false
```

Default is `true`. `false` does **not** remove the guard — it takes the fallback
path above, which means the token. There is no setting in which a guarded call
goes unannounced.

Use it where a dialog is the wrong shape rather than an unwanted one: a scheduled
job, a test harness, a client whose dialog interrupts something else.

::: warning It is deliberately not prefixed
`ELICITATION` has no `NTFY_` in front of it, so one
`export ELICITATION=false` — or one `-e ELICITATION=false` in a compose file —
reaches **every** MCP server in that environment, not just this one. That is the
point of it and also its risk.

Two things make it visible rather than silent:

- a server started with it off prints one line at startup, in the log of every
  server it actually reached:

  ```
  ntfy-mcp: ELICITATION=false — guarded tools fall back to the two-call token
  ```

- the fallback text names the server that did not ask, instead of blaming a
  client that was working fine.
  :::

Anything other than `true` or `false` — `1`, `off`, `yes` — **stops the server**
with exit code 1 and a message naming both valid values. This is the only
variable in this family that defaults to _on_: a typo that fell back to the
default would leave the dialog running while the operator believed it was off,
and there would be nothing to tell them.

## Annotations are the other half, and they are only a hint

Every tool of this server declares all four MCP tool annotations —
`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`, `openWorldHint` — so a
client can tell before it calls what a call would do. See
[Tools](/reference/tools).

They are advice, and the specification says so:

> clients **MUST** consider tool annotations to be untrusted unless they come
> from trusted servers

An annotation is something a client may ignore. The dialog is not: it is enforced
here, on the server side, and no answer means no change. The two are different
claims — the annotation says what a call _does_, the dialog decides whether it
_happens_ — which is why a tool can be marked destructive without being guarded.
`update_message` is exactly that case: it replaces the fields of a notification
people already have a copy of, which is destructive, and it is not asked about.

## Behind a gateway

Both protocol revisions are handled from one code path. On `2025-11-25` the
question is pushed to the client; on `2026-07-28` there is no server→client
channel at all, so the call returns `input_required`, ends, and the client
retries carrying the answer.

That answer arrives as ordinary request content, which the SDK does not
validate — so the state that ties an answer to its question is sealed (HMAC). A
reply whose seal does not open, or opens onto a different target, counts as **no
answer** and produces a fresh question rather than an error. The likeliest cause
is not an attack: it is a gateway that put the server to sleep while the person
was reading.

If you run this behind [mcp-hub](https://github.com/ni-c/mcp-hub), the hub passes
elicitation through in both directions; see its
[elicitation guide](https://ni-c.github.io/mcp-hub/guide/elicitation).
