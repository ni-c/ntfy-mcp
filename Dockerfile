# CVE-2026-14456: the pinned base image carries OpenSSL 3.5.7-r0, and Alpine's
# fixed 3.5.8-r0 has not been rebuilt into node:24-alpine yet. Upgrading these
# two packages by name rather than running a blanket `apk upgrade` keeps the
# rest of the image exactly as the digest pins it. Drop this once the base
# image ships the fix.
